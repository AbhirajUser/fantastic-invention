<p>Hello Everyone, So this my 2nd project using Visual Studio code </p>
<p>It is a simple project made using HTML and CSS</p>
<p>Pictures are Pictures and everyone likes them, even i like pictures</p>
<p>Do you like anime, well I do. They are fun watching</p>
<p> So i will add some anime pictures at the end, and i also may reccomend you to watch 'Naruto'. Brotherr, It is so cool to watch.
So I hope, you also like to watch it</p>
<h2> I will also write a project, to tell you how to write an HTML project</h2>
<p>let me tell you some basics of Html, uhh, Just like a sample program like this down</p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>html</h2></p>
<p><h2>head</h2></p>
<p><h2>title</h2></p>
<p>My First HTML Page</p>
<p><h2>/title</h2></p>
<p><h2>/head</h2></p>
<p><h2>body</h2></p>
<p>Hi everyone How are you?</p>
<p><h2>/body</h2></p>
<p><h2>/html</h2></p>
<p>So this is a simple HTML program, which will display a message 'Hi everyone How are you?' on the screen</p>
<p> The application used is the notepad & when you save it just name it as"'_____'.html"</p>
<p><h1> so thanks eveyone for reading this project of Mine</h1></p>
<p><h3>Ohhhhhhhhhhhh,   Yeah i forgot to Mention the picture of the 'Naruto' anime so the pictures are given below.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Hope you like it</h3></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
